Hello, I'm a beginner programmer started a week ago and want to share my progress and keep track 

this program that I made is supposed to create a new txt file and allow users to give python information to put inside such file 
users will also be able to temp(temporary) save it, meaning once the program has looped a specific number of times
you give it and it exit() it would delete all "saved" information. 

This is a mini project you could work on yourself and use this code as help if wanted to, if you are also new 
to programming I recommend checking out these Projects https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/blob/master/README.md
